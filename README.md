## Todo
- clean up the code (these optionals are driving me crazy...)
- search for track AND artist for more certainty
- dynamically update .csv via scraping the website
- improve the UI
 
## You!
Yeah, you! If you want to fork, edit and pull, that'd be great, if not, have fun discovering Apples awesome taste of music.
